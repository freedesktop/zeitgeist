2009-12-01: Zeitgeist 0.3.0
------------------------------

First development release leading up to the stable 0.4 series. This release
features:

 - Complete rework of engine and DBus API. Read: apps written against 0.2.*
   will most certainly need an update (see fx.
   http://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2009-November/msg00019.html)
 - Public Python client API defined in zeitgeist.datamodel and
   zeitgeist.client modules
 - Documented public API with Sphinx (we'll have an URL for you shortly)
 - Changed Ontology from XESAM to Nepomuk.
 - Removed the Storm backend (obsoleted in 0.2.1).
 - Removed the Querymancer backend.
 - Support for event payloads (binary attachments to events)
 - An extension API for the core engine, allowing extensions direct access to the DB
   There are already a handful extensions things in the works here, you will hear
   more about this later

There are a few DISCLAIMERS that needs to be attached to this:

 - The event notification/signals are not yet ready in the new DBus API.
   We expect to have that ready for 0.3.1.
 - We plan to support querying only for available items (eg. filtering out
   deleted files, not listing files on detached USB storage, etc.). However this
   feature is not fully supported yet, even though it is exposed in the API.
 - While we are pretty satisfied with the database layout, there may still be
   changes in the ontologies or concrete data extraction methods. This might
   require that users delete their log databases in order to rebuild them
   with the new definitions. Of course this will no longer happen when we
   go stable
 - Much related to the point above our event ontologies are not yet set in stone,
   and minor changes are expected
 - We have only one logger enabled for now. Namely the one monitoring your
   recent files. In coming releases this logger may well be deprecated in favour
   of application specific plugins.
 - And finally. Please note that this is a *development release*. We can not
   guarantee stability of services nor APIs, although we strive hard to keep
   things stable.

Version 0.2.1
------------------------------

This version's D-Bus API and database is completely backwards-compatible with
version 0.2, and it focuses on compatibility and performance enhancements.

 - Added compatibility with Python version 2.5.
 - Removed the Storm dependency, obtaining general performance improvements.
 - Removed the need for a patched PyGTK.
 - Made the GtkRecentlyUser logger more robust (fixes an infinit loop on some
   systems).
 - Improved performance of DeleteItems and UpdateItems.
 - Fixed a problem with the contents of the EventsChanged signal.
 - Fixed InsertEvents to enforce "mimetype" as a required value.
 - Fixed a bug where the sorting_asc=True in FindEvents would be ignored if
   used together with mode="mostused" (LP: #404947).
 - Highly improved caching.
 - Added a "--quit" option to zeitgeist-daemon to stop any running daemon.
 - General code improvements, new test cases and other minor fixes.


Version 0.2
------------------------------

Initial release, because we are that cool :).
