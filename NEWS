Version 0.3.0
------------------------------

 - Complete rework of engine and DBus API
 - Public Python client API defined in zeitgeist.datamodel and
   zeitgeist.dbusutils modules
 - Removed the EngineStart and EngineExit signals.
 - Changed URIs from XESAM to Nepomuk.
 - Removed the Storm backend (obsoleted in 0.2.1).
 - Removed the Querymancer backend (obsoleted in 0.3.0).
 - The "text" property of an item can now be empty, and isn't automatically
   set to the filename in its URI.
 - Application and document focus detection. There's a partial API public
   now, but the full API for contextual relevancy will follow in later
   releases.


Version 0.2.1
------------------------------

This version's D-Bus API and database is completely backwards-compatible with
version 0.2, and it focuses on compatibility and performance enhancements.

 - Added compatibility with Python version 2.5.
 - Removed the Storm dependency, obtaining general performance improvements.
 - Removed the need for a patched PyGTK.
 - Made the GtkRecentlyUser logger more robust (fixes an infinit loop on some
   systems).
 - Improved performance of DeleteItems and UpdateItems.
 - Fixed a problem with the contents of the EventsChanged signal.
 - Fixed InsertEvents to enforce "mimetype" as a required value.
 - Fixed a bug where the sorting_asc=True in FindEvents would be ignored if
   used together with mode="mostused" (LP: #404947).
 - Highly improved caching.
 - Added a "--quit" option to zeitgeist-daemon to stop any running daemon.
 - General code improvements, new test cases and other minor fixes.


Version 0.2
------------------------------

Initial release, because we are that cool :).
