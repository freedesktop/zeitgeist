Notes for contributing to the Zeitgeist engine
==============================================

Coding style
************

In general, follow PEP 8 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>.
Especially try to keep the lines shorter than 80 characters. We are also
using TAB for indention.

Zeitgeist supports Python 2.5 and later.


Testing
*******

Before each commit to lp:zeitgeist the commiter must make sure that our
testsuite in test/ is running successfully.
We aim to get as much code tested as possible. New features and bug fixes
should get doc or unittests.


Documentation
*************

Our public API (code in zeitgeist/) must be fully documented. Code in
_zeitgeist/ is private code and should be documented and written in a
way so that others can understand it.


Changes to the public (DBus) API
********************************

changes to the public API are only possible in a major release series.


Code Review
***********

We are using launchpad's 'merge proposal' feature for our code review
process. Significant changes must have at least one positive vote from
one of the core developers (members of <http://launchpad.net/~zeitgeist>)


Release Tasks
*************
1. Bump version number to $VERSION in configure.ac and VERSION files,
   and the D-Bus API version in _zeitgeist/engine/remote.py, if there
   have been changes to it. Also make sure to bump the 'version' and
   'release' variable in doc/zeitgeist/source/conf.py to something
   sensible (e.g. $VERSION)

2. Update NEWS file by hand
  (hint: you can see the full change log with 'bzr log -n0 -v | less',
   to get a log of all changes after the last release run
   'bzr log -n0 -v -r tag:`bzr tags --sort=time|awk 'END{print $1}'`..|less')

3. Commit your changes (with only these changes!) and push you current branch
   to lp:zeitgeist and lp:~zeitgeist/zeitgeist/zeitgeist-$VERSION
   Before pushing make sure there is a $VERSION tag for the 'release' revision,
   to create one run  'bzr tag $VERSION'.

4. To make sure you have a pristine source tree do a clean checkout of the
   newly created branch:
   
     bzr branch lp:~zeitgeist/zeitgeist/zeitgeist-$VERSION
     
5. Change working dir to your new branch

6. Run './autogen.sh && make && make distcheck'. Unpack the tarball and
   generate it again with "tar -czvf zeitgeist-$VERSION.tar.gz
   zeitgeist-$VERSION" (distcheck's are bigger and may be corrupt).

7. GPG sign the generated tarball with the command:

     gpg --armor --sign --detach-sig zeitgeist-$VERSION.tar.gz

8. Upload the tarball and the generated *.asc GPG signature to the right
   milestone on Launchpad

9. Send announcement email to the mailing lists:

    + zeitgeist@lists.launchpad.net
    + gnome-zeitgeist-users@lists.launchpad.net
    + gnome-announce-list@gnome.org

10. Post a news update on the Launchpad project page based on your
    announcement email

11. Make sure that the API documentation on zeitgeist-project.com is updated

12. Now you deserve a treat!

Bugs
****

The zeitgeist project is using the bugtracker on launchpad.net. To report
a bug please visit https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/zeitgeist/+filebug
and describe the issues you are having. Please also add useful information
like the version of zeitgeist you are using and the python version.
Appart from classical bugreport describing an issue or failure, the
zeitgeist team is using the bugtracker to discuss new features and
implementation details.

Bugtriaging
***********

The zeitgeist project is using bug status as described below:
 * New: no bugtriager had a look at this bugreport
 * Incomplete: the zeitgeist team has asked an explicit question
   to get a better understanding of the bug and is waiting for
   an answer from the original reporter or anyobne having the same issue
 * Invalid: It turned out that the issue is not a bug in zeitgeist, or
   cannot be fixed in zeitgeist.
 * Won't Fix: based on the information we got on the bugreport we decided
   that we don't want to fix this bug in a reasonable timeframe.
 * Triaged: Based on the information in the bugreport zeitgeist developers
   understand the issue and are able to start fixing it.
 * In Progress: Someone is working on a fix. There should be a branch
   attached to the bugreport, and the zeitgeist task should be assigned to
   the developer who is working on the fix.
 * Fix Committed: The fix for this bug has been merged into lp:zeitgeist.
   When setting this status the triager should add information about the
   revision in which the fix landed, and also ask the reporter and other
   affected user to test the fix.
 * Fix Released: The fix was released in a release of zeitgeist.
The 'Opinion' status is not used by zeitgeist.

The importance of a bug is set by following this criterias:
 * Undecided: No decission has been made.
 * Wishlist: we are marking feature requests as wishlist
 * Low: issues affecting only a small number of users are marked as Low
 * Medium: bugs which are affecting a significantly number of users are
   of medium importance. 
 * High: This class of bugs must be fixed before the next release, esp.
   failures of our testsuite are resulting in bugs which are marked as
   'High'. Also different kind of regressions (crashes, performance etc.)
   are marked with this importance.
 * Critical: This bug status is very carefully used by zeitgeist,
   whenever this status is set all development ressources are put into
   fixing this bug, no changes to lp:zeitgeist are allowed until this
   bug get fixed. Example for this kind of bugs include build errors,
   undocumented API changes or instantaneous crashes of the
   zeitgeist-daemon.
 
Milestones:
 * If we plan to fix a bug with a status of 'Wishlist', 'Low' or 'Medium'
   we should target this bug to a milestone
 * 'High' and 'Critical' rated bugs will always be targeted to the next
   milestone.
 
Related policies:
 * Every bug of status 'Triaged' or higher should have an importance other
   than 'Undecided'.
 * Each bug with status higher than 'In Progress' should get an assignee.
   Assigning a bug to a dev should never be done without talking to him/her.

Blueprints
**********

Blueprints are used in the zeitgeist project to describe a development
story. Whenever a certain feature requires fixes for multiple bugs or
multiple branches to be merged we use blueprints to organize the efforts
under one central umbrella. The assignee of a blueprint is leading all
the work to get this blueprint and all its features/fixes implemented.
