==============================================
Notes for contributing to the Zeitgeist engine
==============================================

Coding style
************

In general, follow PEP 8 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>.
Especially try to keep the lines shorter than 80 characters. We are also
using TAB for indention.

Zeitgeist supports Python 2.5 and later.


Testing
*******

Before each commit to lp:zeitgeist the commiter must make sure that our
testsuite in test/ is running successfully.
We aim to get as much code tested as possible. New features and bug fixes
should get doc or unittests.


Documentation
*************

Our public API (code in zeitgeist/) must be fully documented. Code in
_zeitgeist/ is private code and should be documented and written in a
way so that others can understand it.


Changes to the public (DBus) API
********************************

changes to the public API are only possible in a major release series.


Code Review
***********

We are using launchpad's 'merge proposal' feature for our code review
process. Significant changes must have at least on positive vote from
one of the core developers (members of <http://launchpad.net/~zeitgeist>)


Release Tasks
*************
[...] TBD - FIXME [...]
